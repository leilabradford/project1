				<td class="box"> <strong> The biggest goal in my life is making it to the Junior Olympics. As I get older, I want to try and push for the Olympics. 
 If I make it to the Junior Olympics I will be so happy and I know for a fact I would have 100% support from my family. 
 Track and field have always been my specialty and when I am in a race nothing is on my mind but to win this race. 
 This will be my 6th year running track and I feel as if that I have grown a lot. I have gotten stronger and faster. 
 My favorite race is the 4 by 1. The 4 by 1 is basically 4 people on the track and they each run 100 meters. 
 In the midst of running the 4 by 1, we have to pass something called a baton. 
 I personally like the 4 by 1 because it is a team-bonding race, we have to work together. 
 This race just does not depend on one person. When I am on the field waiting for the race, all I am thinking about is winning. 
 As I am actually running I zone out and donâ€™t think about anything. </strong> </td>
